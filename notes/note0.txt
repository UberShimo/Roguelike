Boss:
The bastard (me):
Just runs away from you in zig zag then gets exhausted and rests...
Unless you are Bard. Then you jam together until you kill him!


3 levels:
1: monsters with 2 items.
2: more monsters with 2 items.
3: Boss

There are 3 random maps that will be chosen for level 1 and 2.
Level 3 is boss.

You can get achievments on each class. (Win with over 100 HP, Win fast, Win without items, Beat certain time in endless mode)
Beating game with a class unlocks next "level".
In "Endless mode" it spawns more and more monsters and you gotta survive as long as possible.
